Computer Graphics Final Project

This folder holds the executable game.

Final_Project.zip contains the orginal Unity project with code.

I didn't get to fully implement all the features I wanted to 
because of time constraints. Along with all the other work I had for
other classes, and having to go back home for the semester, making the 
final project that I wanted ended up being harder than I thought it
would be.
